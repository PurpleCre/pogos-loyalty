# Overview

Loyalty app for a restaraunt written in React with Capacitor conversion and Android Studio.

The app is designed to show useres promotions and to mainly track their purchases while also rewarding them at key moments. The app uses google qr scanner to scan receipts and award points for each purchase. To use the app, open it, create an account or login, tap scan qr and scan the code (Which you wont have for now). You can also browse the other functions.

The app is meant to reward loyal customers which free meals at certain milestones, while also collecting data to enhance the service offered by the restaurant.

# Development Environment

I used React to build a mobile first webapp, then I converted it to an android app using capicator through vscode, finally I made improvements and intergrations in android studio before shipping a release version of the app.

I used React with capacitor, then kotlin and java for the entire project.
